# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict car prices based on various features such as brand, model, mileage, year, and more. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature encoding for categorical data
- Correlation heatmap analysis
- Linear Regression model training and evaluation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/car-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset `car_prices.csv` into the project directory.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python car_price_prediction.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset
   - Perform exploratory data analysis
   - Train a Linear Regression model
   - Evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error and R-squared metrics

## Data Source
The dataset should include:
- **Price**: The target variable representing car prices
- **Features**: Various attributes like year, brand, mileage, etc.

Ensure the dataset is formatted correctly as a CSV file.

## Results
- Insights from EDA and correlation analysis
- Model evaluation metrics (MSE and R-squared)
- Predicted car prices based on test data
